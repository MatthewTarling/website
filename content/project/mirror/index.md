Fault mirrors are tectonically polished, highly reflective fault slip surfaces. These mirror-like surfaces form when slip along a fault plane, in combination with a range of possible physical processes (heat, comminution, fluid alteration, production of gels or nanograins), results in a reduction in surface roughness at the scale of the wavelength of visible light (100s of nanometers).
