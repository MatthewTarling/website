New methodologies in serpentinite micro-structural and -mineralogical Raman mapping has led to the discovery of previous unseen fault rocks textures in crack-seal veins, consisting of alternative bands of lizardite and chrysotile. These textures capture new details about the crack-seal process and may be a record of rapid incremental crack opening and a potential signature of micro-earthquakes.
