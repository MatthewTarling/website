The mineral magnetite is a ubiquitous component of serpentinite shears zones. While it might only makes up 5-15% of the serpentinite, it can often occur at critical sites, like along foliation planes or smeared along slip surfaces. Understanding how this magnetite is deforming is key to developing a full picture of slip in serpentinite faults!

This EBSD map shows that magnetite can deform in surprising ways, forming incredibly complex microstructures. I am using a range of micro- to nano-analytical techniques to learn how magnetite deforms in serpentinite faults and the role it play in controlling fault deformation behaviour.
