Apart from the thin sections themselves, the polariser filters are the only component of the project that cannot be 3D printed ([at least not yet in the visible spectrum of light!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9372518)).



Thankfully linear polarisers are readily available online. It is absolutely key that you get **linear** polarising film. I have found that by searching for "LCD/LED Polarized Filter Polarizing Film Sheet for Polarization" on Amazon you can find decent deals. I have been able to find 30 x 20cm linear polariser sheets for about $20CAD for 5. with care, I can cut 6 filters for the slide viewer per sheet, bringing the price per filter to about $0.7CAD each.
