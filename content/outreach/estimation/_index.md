title: Estimation of DSGE model parameters
#linktitle: Estimation of DSGE model parameters
summary: In these tutorials and videos I will present the theory and practice of parameter estimation in linear and non-linear DSGE models using several examples and Dynare's *estimation* and *method-of-moments* toolbox. I will cover both full-information methods (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC) as well as limited-information methods (GMM, SMM and GIRF-matching).
