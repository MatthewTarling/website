## What you will learn
In these tutorials and videos I show how to install and setup Dynare, MATLAB and Octave on Windows, MacOS and Linux. I will cover both installations for desktop computers/laptops as well as deployments on Linux clusters/servers. Moreover, I show how to setup Dynare to run certain computations and tasks in parallel.
