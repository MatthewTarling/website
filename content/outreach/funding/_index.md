Until now, this project has been privately funded. I am looking for funding options in addition to accepting donations from those interested in financially contributing to the project. Initial funding will serve to pay for postage as well as build a larger number of traveling thin section collections. 

Looking forward, I would like to build tha capacity to print and distribute thin section viewers, with slides, to groups that might not have the resources to built it themselves. 

I am accepting donations towards this project, as well as making [custom thin section box design(https://matthewtarling.github.io/printing/) in exchange to contributions to *Viewing the Rock World*.
