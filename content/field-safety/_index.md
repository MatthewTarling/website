Fieldwork is an essential part of my job as a field-based geologist, in both my research and teaching. Preparing for safe field work means evaluating, understanding and mitigating environmental risks, along with the development of emergency plans and contingency measures. However it goes well beyond making sure no one get physically hurt. A critical aspect to safe fieldwork is that the well-being and mental health of all participants is considered at all times, in all activities. 

Along with members of the [Field Rheology Rowe Research Group](https://www.eps.mcgill.ca/~crowe/), I developed a [Field Safety Plan](EPS_Field_Safety_Plan.pdf) to help groups at McGill plan for safe, inclusive fieldwork while generating important conversations about [identity-based risks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5) and strategies to mitigate them.


Fieldwork has acted as a barrier to involvement in the Earth Sciences, and it is our responsibility to actively dismantle these obstacles and make the field a more inclusive space. This also means have frank and open conversations and making sure participants that may not have extensive outdoors experience are given the information and tools they need to thrive while considering everyone's personal needs.
