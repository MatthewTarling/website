I designed 3D-printable thin section boxes after the McGill University [Field Rheology Rowe Research Group](https://www.eps.mcgill.ca/~crowe/) expressed interest in having some made. There are several models available, from a simple box that holds 5 thin sections with a friction-fit lid, to more intricate boxes based on a design of a hinged box with a clasp that you can find [here](https://www.printables.com/model/540605-parametric-box-v2-single-clasp). All boxes were designed for printing with PLA filament. 

I provide all the .STL files for these boxes below for free. If you feel inclined, you can show your appreciation by donating to support the [*Viewing the Rock World* outreach project](https://matthewtarling.github.io/outreach).

[![Donate with PayPal button](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=PCTMMUKZF9M4A)


 For a donation of $30CAD to [*Viewing the Rock World*](https://matthewtarling.github.io/outreach), I will design a custom branded box for you with a name or logo of your choosing embossed into the lid for you to print! See [below](#section-4) for an example and more details. Reach out to me if you would like a custom box made for different capacity or slide sizes and we can discuss the details.

If you print one of these boxes, please send me a pictures and I will add it to a gallery at the end of this page!
