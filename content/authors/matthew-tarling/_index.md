**Welcome!** 


As a field-based structural geologist, I study how rocks squish and break in the interior of the Earth. I'm currently a postdoc in the [Field Rheology Rowe Research Group](https://www.eps.mcgill.ca/~crowe/) at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada. For more details on my research, check out my [research project page.]({{< ref "https://matthewtarling.github.io/#projects" >}} "Research")


I'm passionate about outreach and interested in developing new tools to increase interest and recruitment in the Earth Sciences. To find out more check my latest outreach project [*Viewing the Rock World*.]({{< ref "https://matthewtarling.github.io/outreach" >}} "Outreach")
