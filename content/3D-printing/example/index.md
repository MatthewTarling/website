 I've recently been playing around with designing 3D printable thin section boxes after the McGill University Field Rheology research group expressed interest in having some made. The first is a very simple box that hold 5 thin section with a friction fit lid. From there I designed slight more intricate boxes, based on a design of a hinged box with a clasp that you can find [here](https://www.printables.com/model/540605-parametric-box-v2-single-clasp).
